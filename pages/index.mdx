## Victoria McNorrill

Hello there. I code for people, places and things. Currently, I'm a Software Engineering Apprentice at [Purple Wren Digital](https://purplewrendigital.com/) through [Develop Carolina](https://www.developcarolina.org/).

I am especially curious and passionate about UX Design, Artificial Intelligence, and sustainability in tech.
