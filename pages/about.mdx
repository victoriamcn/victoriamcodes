### About

  I thrive on challenges and love the process of solving complex problems. As a
  full-stack developer, I bring a holistic understanding of both front-end and
  back-end technologies, allowing me to architect robust solutions from start to
  finish. My previous experiences in communications, customer service and
  management has taught me the importance of understanding the end user. This
  invaluable perspective drives my approach to software development â€“ ensuring
  that the applications I create not only meet technical standards but also
  resonate with the needs and expectations of the intended audience.


  I hold a [Full Stack Certificate](https://pe.gatech.edu/certificates) from the
  Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned a [Bachelor of Arts in Mass
  Communication](https://www.ngu.edu/programs/strategic-communication/communication/)
  from North Greenville University, where I honed my skills in writing,
  copyediting, graphic design, and layout design.
