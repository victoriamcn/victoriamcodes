## BACKGROUND & EDUCATION

I thrive on challenges and love the process of solving complex problems. As a full-stack developer, I bring a holistic understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to architect robust solutions from start to finish. My previous experiences in communications, customer service and management has taught me the importance of understanding the end user. This invaluable perspective drives my approach to software development â€“ ensuring that the applications I create not only meet technical standards but also resonate with the needs and expectations of the intended audience.

I hold a [Full Stack Certificate](https://pe.gatech.edu/certificates) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned a [Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication](https://www.ngu.edu/programs/strategic-communication/communication/) from North Greenville University, where I honed my skills in writing, copyediting, graphic design, and layout design.

Always learning and improving.
